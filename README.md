  Go Rank Pairing Queue is an implementation of the said data structure written in go.
  It offers advantages over a traditional queue as it supports the following operations.
  
  Operations	  Amortized time
  find-min	    O(1)
  delete-min	  O(log n)
  insert	      O(1)
  decrease-key	O(1)
  size	        O(1)
  delete-all	  O(n)
  
  With lower complexity than most Priority Queue implementations.
  Feel free to use it, have fun !!.
